        <h2>
            document.addEventListener("keydown", disableF5):
        </h2>
        <p>
            This event catches all keydown events and checks for F5 (refresh operation) "keydown" event.<br>
            after such key code was identified (key-code 116), the event calls a function named "disableF5()" which is
            in Worker.js.<br>
        <h5>*this event catches all keydown events that happen from the keyboard and mouse.</h5>
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="2">
        <h2>
            disableF5(event):
        </h2>
        <p>
            disableF5(): this function will verify that the key pressed is actually F5 and disables it.<br>
            after verification that F5 was pressed, it terminates the F5 operation and calls refreshWaiter().<br>
        <h5>*this function will do nothing if the key code is NOT 116 (F5) <br> *this function will not catch any other
            kind of refresh operation like Ctrl+R nor manual refresh.</h5>

        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="3">
        <h2>refreshWaiter():</h2>
        <p>
            This function will hide all menus and the board, and show the player a decision "menu" with two buttons <br>
            to decide weather to refresh or not.<br>
            -if the user chose <strong>to refresh</strong>- the local storage will be cleaned,<br>
            all statistics will be reseted and you will go to the main menu to start a new game<br>
            -if the user chose <strong>NOT to refresh</strong>- the game board will be shown again (with no game
            progress nor player statistics changes -game will continue as nothing happend )<br>
            and all other forms and menus will be hidden<br>
